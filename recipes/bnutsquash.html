            <li>1 1/2 tbsp unrefined cocnut oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots, diced</li>
            <li>Kosher salt to taste</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2&rdquo; piece ginger, grated or finely minced</li>
            <li>1-3 bird's eye chili peppers, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 stalks fresh lemongrass, minced or grated</li>
            <li>5 tbsp red curry paste</li>
            <li>1 (13.5 oz) (400 ml) can full-fat coconut milk</li>
            <li>1 cup (240 ml) low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
            <li>5 cups (700-730 g) peeled and cubed butternut squash</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tbsp reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp coconut sugar</li>
            <li>2 15-oz (425 g) cans of chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>4 cups (60 g) baby spinach or baby kale</li>
            <li>1 tbsp lime juice or rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 large handful fresh cilantro, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 handful thai basil leaves</li>
            <li>White or brown rice (for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a Dutch oven or a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the coconut oil, and once shimmering, add the onions and carrots along with a pinch of kosher salt. Cook the vegetables for 7-8 minutes, or until they are tender and lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, ginger, chili peppers (if using), lemongrass (if using), and red curry paste, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently to coat the vegetables & prevent burning. If not using a nonstick pan, you'll likely need to add a tablespoon or two of water to prevent the mixture from drying out, sticking, and burning.</li>
            <li>Pour in a couple spoons of the coconut milk and allow it to bubble for a minute, stirring well. Add the vegetable broth, stirring with a spatula to scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Pour in the remaining coconut milk, cubed squash, soy sauce, and coconut sugar, stirring to combine.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low or medium-low to maintain a rapid simmer for 20 minutes, or until the squash is tender and cooked through.</p>
                <p>Turn off the heat and use an immersion blender to blend roughly half of the curry. Make sure to leave some chunks of squash intact.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, transfer half of the curry to a stand blender. Blend until the mixture is pur√©ed and mostly smooth, then return it to the pan and stir to combine.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Stir in the chickpeas and bring the curry to a gentle simmer. Once simmering, stir in the baby spinach or kale, stirring until the greens have wilted.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat, and stir in the lime juice or rice vinegar. Taste for seasonings, adding salt as needed. Tear the Thai basil leaves to release their oils; add them to the curry, along with the chopped cilantro.</li>
            <li>Serve the curry over rice. Garnish with additional cilantro or Thai basil as desired.</li>
        </ol>
