        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>If you went to your farmers market over the weekend and came home with a beautiful bunch of carrots, then this carrot soup recipe is for you. They&rsquo;re the main ingredient in this easy recipe, along with a few staples that you likely already have in your kitchen.</p>

        <p>This easy soup recipe is just 7 ingredients, and it&rsquo;s so simple and delicious with no cream, no cashew cream, and no coconut cream (ok just a tad for garnish, but it&rsquo;s really not necessary). The creamy base of the soup comes purely from the pureed carrots.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
            <li>1 pound carrots, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 tsp grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>3 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp maple syrup, optional</li>
            <li>coconut milk for garnish, optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions, salt and pepper and cook until softened, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Add the smashed garlic cloves (they&rsquo;ll get blended later) and carrots to the pot and cook 8 minutes more, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Stir in the ginger, apple cider vinegar, and broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let cool slightly and transfer to a blender. Blend until smooth. If your soup is too thick, add a little water. If you would like your soup a little sweeter, add the maple syrup.</li>
            <li>Serve with a drizzle of coconut milk, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
